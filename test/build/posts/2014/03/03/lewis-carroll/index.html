While she was looking at the place where it had been,  it suddenly appeared again.</p>
<p>&#39;By-the-bye, what became of the baby?&#39; said the Cat. &#39;I&#39;d nearly  forgotten to ask.&#39;</p>

<p>&#39;It turned into a pig,&#39; Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back  in a natural way.</p>
<p>&#39;I thought it would,&#39; said the Cat, and vanished again.</p>
<p>Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not  appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in  which the March Hare was said to live. &#39;I&#39;ve seen hatters before,&#39; she  said to herself; &#39;the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and  perhaps as this is May it won&#39;t be raving mad-at least not so mad as  it was in March.&#39; As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat  again, sitting on a branch of a tree.</p>
<p>&#39;Did you say pig, or fig?&#39; said the Cat.</p>
<p>&#39;I said pig,&#39; replied Alice; &#39;and I wish you wouldn&#39;t keep appearing and  vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.&#39;</p>
<p>&#39;All right,&#39; said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,  beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which  remained some time after the rest of it had gone.</p>
<p>&#39;Well! I&#39;ve often seen a cat without a grin,&#39; thought Alice; &#39;but a grin  without a cat! It&#39;s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!&#39;</p>
